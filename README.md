# About The Case

The data for this case is collected during the Natural Language Processing (NLP) simulation. 

Within this project, my team designed a survey, interviewed participants by using Otter.ai (speech to text transcription and translation app) and built a Shiny Application to provide and present insights from a large collection of text documents about the premier advertising event of the year - Superbowl- for a local beer company.

Implemented frameworks for this analysis; Correlograms, Correlation test, Frequency Histograms, Sentiment Analysis, TF-IDF Analysis, Bi-gram & N-gram, Word clouds, Word Correlation Network.
