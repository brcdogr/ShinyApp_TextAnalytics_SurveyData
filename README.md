#About The Case

The data for this case is collected during the Natural Language Processing (NLP) simulation survey by using Otter.ai (speech to text transcription). 
My team designed a Shiny Application to provide insights from a large collection of text documents about the premier advertising event of the year (Superbowl) for a beer company.
